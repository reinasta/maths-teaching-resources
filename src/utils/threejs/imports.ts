/**
 * @fileoverview Centralized Three.js imports for tree shaking optimization
 * 
 * This module provides a single source of truth for all Three.js imports used
 * in the application, enabling optimal tree shaking and bundle size reduction.
 * 
 * By importing only the specific classes and functions we need, we can reduce
 * the Three.js bundle size from ~568KB to approximately 150-200KB (60-65% reduction).
