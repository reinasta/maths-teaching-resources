## Worksheet Overview

This worksheet provides comprehensive practice with the laws of indices (also known as exponent rules). Students will work through various problems involving:

- Multiplication of powers with the same base
- Division of powers with the same base
- Power of a power rule
- Zero and negative indices
- Fractional indices

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this worksheet, students will be able to:

1. Apply the multiplication law: $a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$
2. Apply the division law: $a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n}$
3. Apply the power law: $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$
4. Work with zero indices: $a^0 = 1$
5. Handle negative indices: $a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$
6. Understand fractional indices: $a^{\frac{1}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a}$ (nth root of a)

## Key Concepts

### The Three Main Laws

1. **Multiplication Law**: When multiplying powers with the same base, add the indices
2. **Division Law**: When dividing powers with the same base, subtract the indices
3. **Power Law**: When raising a power to another power, multiply the indices

### Special Cases

- **Zero Index**: Any number (except zero) raised to the power of zero equals 1
  - Example: $5^0 = 1$, $(-3)^0 = 1$
- **Negative Indices**: Represent reciprocals of positive powers
  - Example: $2^{-3} = \frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}$
- **Fractional Indices**: Represent roots and can be combined with other operations
  - Example: $8^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{8} = 2$
  - Example: $16^{\frac{3}{4}} = (\sqrt[4]{16})^3 = 2^3 = 8$
